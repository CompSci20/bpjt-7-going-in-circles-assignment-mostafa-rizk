# BPJT-7-Going-In-Circles-Assignment
Complete the _Going In Circles_ Assignment in [Lesson 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1txkcFJNP38F02N9CfXSnaqQdfTvoOtgE/view?usp=sharing) in [BPJT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khkhu3q0Rbj6VumUkwz1lBz6oSWMF_XH/view?usp=sharing). 

The area of a circle is given by: area = π (r2)

Now, suppose we know the area and wish to find r. Solving for r from this equation yields: r = √(area / π)

Write a program (project and class both named RadiusOfCircle) that uses sqrt( ) and PI from the Math class to solve for the radius of a circle. Use keyboard input to specify the
area (provide for the possibility of area being a decimal fraction).

Write out your solution by hand and then enter it into the computer and run. Before inputting the area, put a prompt on the screen like this:

What is the area?

Present your answer like this:

Radius of your circle is 139.4.

Hint 1: Define area and radius as variables so your code is easier to read
Hint 2: Account for the area being a decimal fraction (a.k.a not an int)
